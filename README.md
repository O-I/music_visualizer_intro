# Music Visualizer with Ruby

This is a simple music visualizer coded in Ruby using the [ruby-processing](https://github.com/jashkenas/ruby-processing) gem and the [Minim](http://code.compartmental.net/tools/minim/) Java audio library. Java needs to be installed on your machine to get this working. Run `rp5 run visualizer.rb` to play.
